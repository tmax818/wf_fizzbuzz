## solution branch

Write [code](index.js) that will go through each number from 1 to 100 and:

- For each number that is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz"
- For each number that is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz"
- For numbers which are a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
- All other numbers should just print normally


```bash
1
2
"Fizz"
4
"Buzz"
"Fizz"
7
8
"Fizz"
"Buzz"
11
"Fizz"
13
14
"FizzBuzz"

```
